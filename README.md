# About

Integration plugin between Reactive Commerce and Accelerated text

# Goals
- Allow to upload CSV (Column names matching hardcoded pattern for now)
- Allow to select plan type
- Import will create Products with information and automatically create descriptions

# Quick Start

clone it into `<reaction admin>/import/plugins/custom`

**NOTE** - at the moment `i18n` is in the middle of refactoring in ReactionCommerce. To be able to do translations, `translations` folder needs to be added to `reaction` project, under `src/plugins/custom/acc-text-import` and registered inside `registerPlugins.js`
